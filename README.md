#About Querix Projects, Products, and Axion Client

Querix focuses on Minecraft-related projects using Java, C#, C++, and C. (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used only for internal prototype and animation testing.)
Our mission is to make the game more enjoyable, lightweight, secure, portable, and fair.

Unlike typical custom clients that work solely on the user device, Axion Client offers additional ecosystem-level systems, including:

A dedicated server for ecosystem participants

The proprietary Axion AntiCheat system

AxA (Axion Authentication Authority) for secure client verification

Partnerships and collaborations with selected servers


Axion Client is not affiliated with any similarly named projects. We respect other client developers and do not claim association with them.

Safety Notice — Official Team Will Never:

Querix employees or verified staff members will never:

Request banking or financial account information

Ask for your Microsoft account password or credentials

Ask you to install or download software from unofficial sources

Request remote desktop access or screen sharing

Encourage or tolerate unfair gameplay, cheating, or malicious software usage


Verified Staff Members May Ask For (When Necessary):

Only for identity verification and support purposes, Querix staff may request:

The phone number linked to your Axion Account

The email address registered to your Axion Account

Your Minecraft IGN or AxA UUID

Your AxA (Sora) ecosystem device ID or UUID


Your security and privacy are our highest priority.
